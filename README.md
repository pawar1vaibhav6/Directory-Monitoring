# 🗂️ Directory Monitoring Script

A simple Python project that continuously monitors a specified directory and logs any file changes — including when files are **added**, **modified**, or **deleted**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Detects new files created in the directory  
- Tracks modifications to existing files  
- Identifies deleted or missing files  
- Logs all events with timestamps for easy tracking

## 🧠 What I Learned
- File and directory handling using the `os` module  
- Working with `datetime` for time-based event logging  
- Implementing structured logging for automation tasks

## 💬 About the Project
This project was created to practice automation and file handling in Python.  
It continuously monitors a directory and logs whenever files are added, modified, or deleted.  
Through this, I learned how to use modules like `os`, `datetime`, and `logging` to track system-level changes efficiently.
